*IMPORTANT: THE API OF REMARKABLE CHANGED AND I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN UPDATE REMAPY ACCORDINGLY. SO IT COULD EASILY BE THAT THIS TOOL WILL NOT WORK AGAIN. I'M REALLY SRY AND I WILL TRY MY BEST TO SOLVE IT. ANY HELP IS WELCOME. SEE ALSO THIS [ISSUE](https://github.com/peerdavid/remapy/issues/60)*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RemaPy is an open-source file explorer for your reMarkable tablet that uses the
reMarkable cloud. You can upload documents (via copy and paste), open notebooks
and annotated pdfs and delete documents or collections. RemaPy is written in
Python and only tested on Linux. Thanks to the community for adding scripts
and code to make RemaPy also executable on Windows!
Note that for OSX we have currently some  problems with RemaPy.
See also [Issue 10](https://github.com/peerdavid/remapy/issues/10).
A "how to install", the software architecture and FAQ's
can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/peerdavid/RemaPy/wiki).

*Snapped highlights of rM v2.7 are now supported!*

## Open with or without annotations
With RemaPy you can open the annotated pdf file (double click). You can also
open the original file without annotations or you can open the file containing
only the pages that are annotated (right-click). If evince is installed on your
system, RemaPy opens the same page as on your tablet. Note that if you open a
collection, all child items are opened recursively.

## Upload pdfs, epubs or webpages
If you copy and paste a file from your file explorer into RemaPy, it
is uploaded if the file ends with .pdf or .epub. Select the base folder
(or any item in this folder) where the file should be located after the upload.
If you copy and paste a URL, the given website is automatically converted into
a pdf and uploaded to your reMarkable. Note that some heuristics
are implemented to accepts the "terms of usage" of pages automatically,
but this will not work in every case
(see also [FAQ](https://github.com/peerdavid/RemaPy/wiki)). Please also note
that some additional packages must be installed to use this feature
(pdfkit and wkhtmltopdf).

## Rendering and custom colors
The rendering is implemented accordingly to [4]:<br />

Custom colors for individual layers are used by RemaPy for rendering
if the layer name contains a '#' followed by a valid color name or
[hex code](https://www.color-hex.com/).
For example "Layer1 #ffee11" is rendered with hex color #ffee11 or "Layer 2 #red"
is rendered in red. The hex code also supports alpha values (e.g. #ffee11dd).
Therefore you can easily hide layers in the rendering process by setting the last
two values of the hex code to zero: #xxxxxx00.<br />

## Filter
You can use the filter (upper right) to display only a subset of documents and
collections (not case sensitive). To search only for bookmarked items, start
your search string with "!b". For example to search for all bookmarked items
that contain "RemaPy", enter "!b RemaPy".
To search all items that contain "RemaPy" enter only "RemaPy".

## Backup
In the settings tab you can find an option "Backup". This creates a
backup of all your annotated pdf files into the given folder. Note that it
it is not possible to backup or restore the *raw* items.

## Trash
RemaPy uses the same delete logic than the ReMarkable V2.2. Therefore if
you delete a collection or a document, it is moved into the trash.
You can delete the item completely from the tablet if you delete it inside
the trash. You can also restore files that are deleted from the trash.
*NOTE: If you create a backup, the trash is also included.*

## Other features
 - Rename or delete items
 - Toggle bookmark
 - Offline mode
